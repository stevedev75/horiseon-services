# <Horiseon Services Web Page>

## Description 
 
 My motivation for this project was to create a clean, one page web page with vibrant graphics
 and symbols to convey the core products the client wishes to market in this application:
 search engine optimization, online peputation management social media marketing as the main
 focal points, and lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management as secondary points.

 I built this project to connect my client with best-fit customers who have social media needs
 that my client can address.

 This application solves the problem my client has with the ongoing process of always needing
 to find the next client.

 In this project I learned a tremendous amount about using better semantic html elements while
 optimizing css indicators.
